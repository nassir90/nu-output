<h1>Benefits of using linux</h1>
<h2>Linux:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Uses less memory.</li>
<li>Doesn't do automatic updates.</li>
<li>Has better command line utilities, which are often quicker to use than their graphical couterparts.
The list is endless.</li>
<li>Is more customisable in that:<ul>
<li>You can change what the GUI looks like.
See: <a href="https://gnome.org">GNOME</a>, <a href="https://xfce.org">XFCE</a>, <a href="https://kde.org">KDE</a> and <a href="https://www.ubuntupit.com/best-linux-desktop-environment-reviewed-and-compared/">more</a>.</li>
<li>You can use scripts to automate basic tasks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is less bloated in that:<ul>
<li>It doesn't send telemetry data to Microsoft.
If you care about privacy, don't use Windows.</li>
<li>It doesn't waste your resources with an 'antivirus' that you'll never use.</li>
<li>It puts more emphasis on plain text files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is quicker to start up, even with a hard drive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people only need to browse the web and access their documents.
Activities like these can be done on linux (obviously) without the Micro$oft crud.</p>
<p>So unless you're a gamer, switching to linux is be a good choice.
Even at that, there are ways of playing windows games on linux, namely with <a href="https://winehq.org">wine</a> and the Steam-backed <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/">proton</a>.</p>
