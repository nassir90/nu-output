<h1>"Why Kaufman Is Wrong"</h1>
<p>Assume exosomes share the genotype of their parent cells.
When exosomes are sequenced, their similarity to the parent can be determined.
Kaufman claims that the particles being produced in Vero cells when exposed to 'toxins' and viri are exosomes.
This would be a contradiction, as we would not claim that we were observing viri if the genome were equivalent to that of Vero cells.
(Though I did see reports of the supposed Sars-Cov-2 genotype being found in the human body, so it is not necessarily a contradiction. In addition, if PCR is being used to determine what is contained in the cell culture, it's plausable, though unlikely, given the small size of primers, that false replication could occur)</p>
<p>Cell membranes have surface cell receptors.
It is conceivable then, that a particular structure could expose antigens that make it look like something it isn't.
Kaufman compares the cell membrane to a 'steel wall' in terms of tensile strength.
Though this doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility of 'viral hijacking', as it is not tensile strength but the nature of the antigen that determines whether a particle is allowed inside the cell.</p>
<p>Kaufman claims that bacteria and fungi are present opportunistically due to the presence of dead and dying tissue, and not only that but the microbes are a natural part of the tissue's regeneration.
This makes sense, as by definition, dead tissue is dead weight; what can't be brought back to life must be destroyed somehow.
Therefore, they are claiming that that all microbes are saprophytic, which is a statement subject to the rigours of statistical analysis.
The video maker argues from the absurdity of the idea, which is a good heuristic, but not much else.</p>
<p>Kaufman, talking on vaccines, is either claiming that cultured cells are inherently filthy (which I don't understand) or refering again to the idea that one can only produce exosomes in a toxic culture, the toxicity of which cannot or is not fully removed when put in a vaccine.
If the first point is what he intended to say, I can see why the author calls this a contradiction.
Though if the former is what he intended, Kaufman isn't really contradicting himself.</p>
<p>Kaufman does act in bad faith when he claims that only four articles claim to isolate Sars-Cov-2.
There is an editorial, which by definition is not scientific.
There's a centrifugal genotyping paper, which is not isolation; the author doesn't heed ideas concerning isolation.</p>
<p>The author repeatedly comments on Kaufman's stupidity.
Perhaps I am to emphatic, but in this case, I don't think that he's a stupid person.
His world view is relatively consistent, and his reasoning in this context makes sense.
If he is wrong, he is merely misguided, not stupid.</p>
<p>Kaufman calims that Dr Jaims Hildreth concedes that: "the virus is fully an exosome in every sense of the word".
I looked at the paper, and indeed Dr James Hildreth is not claiming that viri don't cause disease, he is claiming that exosomes do cause disease.
I still don't think that Kaufman has the <em>mens rea</em>, he is misinformed in this case.</p>
