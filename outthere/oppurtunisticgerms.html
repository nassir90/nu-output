	<h1>Germ theory - cringe or facts?</h1>
	
	<p>Should we "stay home and protect each other"? Probably not. Probably not because germ theory is wrong though. Saying this, the 'novel coronavirus may well not cause COVID19 (neither Koch's nor River's postulates have been demonstrated). This is nothing new. Experiments have been done that show that the mode of spread of certain well known diseases isn't through microorganisms, as is commonly thought.</p>
	
	<p>One such study was done in the 1910s, when the spanish flu was ravaging the USA. A doctor by the name of Milton J. Rosenau wanted to prove that <em>Pfeiffer Bacillus</em> (a bacterium) was responsible for the disease. He carried out an experiment, in which he exposed healthy individuals to the breath, the sputum and even the blood of "infected" individuals. Not one of them fell ill [0. Also see note about how the spanish flu is now pinned on a virus].</p>
	
	<p>The mechanism for bacterial and fungal pathogenesis is said to be that these germs produce substances that kill the cells in our body, or that they themselves are parasitic and kill our tissues to propagate themselves. I think it would be more accurate to take a step back and look at what enables the microbes to thrive in the first place. We don't see microbial growth in a wound containing dead tissue, as being independent from the cut, similarly we shouldn't see other instances of microbial growth as independent from a more definite catalyst.</p>
	
	<p>Under this 'opportunistic germ theory', parasites may be explained away to be a result of such a catalyst hurting the host and a 'parasite' thiving as dead and dying tissues are easier to digest. E.g. Many cases of malaria result when individuals come in contact with marsh gases and industry exhausts, such as methane, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia.</p>
	
	<p>Tuberculosis is another well known illness that is hard to blame on a germ. It's a known fact that there some billions of people on the face of planet earth harbouring the bacterium deemed responsible for TB. Are all of these people sick? No. Within the germ theory paradigm, stumped reasearchers chock this down to latent TB. I am not a researcher, but I'm of the opinion that all 'infections' are latent for most people. This would explain the discrepancy between the amount of people with a germ in their system, and the disease associated with the germ. Some people are just genetically predisposed to certain conditions, e.g. people with malformed or inflamed lungs as in bronchiechitasis.</p>
	
	<p>Individuals with AIDS are more likely to have 'latent TB' develop to active TB. However, this may be bias due to the lifestyle of the individual who contracts HIV (aphrodisiacs, drug injections, malnorishment)[3]. You'd also think that latent TB wouldn't be possible in AIDS patients, only active TB.</p>
	
	<p>And I can't ignore the caricature of germ theory that was made by the media in response to people 'dying of coronavirus' on ventilators. No, people died because ventilators are extremely invasive, and can actually stretch the tissues in the lungs to extreme levels. When you have dying lung tissues, combined with air not being filtered as normal by the nose, you're essentially laying the ground for all kinds of microbes to grow. Hence, we see deaths of ventilator assisted pneumonia, not 'of coronavirus'.</p>
	
	<center><p>Though: <em>"There is no dictum so false that it does not contain some particle of truth"</em></p></center>
	
	<p>Antibiotics still serve a last resort role, and have undoubtedly saved many lives that would have died due to microbial activity. That said, the ideal of health has to shift from the eradication of germs to a good diet and having a good lifestyle, and to avoid the use of antibiotics in the first place. The biggest plagues of our day are junk food and sedentary work, now that cities aren't the fetid seas of yore.</p>
	
	<p>This means that what it means to die from a germ based illness also has to be reanalysed. With the scamdemic, we're seeing that most people that die have underlying conditions, so much so that the 'novel' coronavirus may be a new <em>Pfeiffer Bacillus</em>. It's conceivable that in a world where we focused more on the chronic and less on the acute, the scamdemic couldn't even be perpetrated, as the media would have to fake such a large amount of deaths that the hoax would be apparent to most of the population [2].</p>
	
	<p>In the old version of this article, I flat out denied germ theory. That was a generalisation to the whole of disease that can not be made so hastily. What I do know is that, as an abstract bit of trivia, it can't be denied that chronic conditions give microbes a place to thrive. This I don't think I can deny. This article was written really just to say something against the scamdemic, but I don't think that germ theory is where the consparicy is. Yet.</p>

	<p>[2] That's, if people think for themselves. There's a theory that the reason most people believe in the pandemic, despite <a href="maybe.html">the locality argument and the statistical argument</a>, not becauase people have gotten dumber, but because we naturally allow the media to think for us. Thus, people were more based in the past because the media they consumed was a bit more honest.</p>
