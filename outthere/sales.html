	<h1>The pandemic protection superstition</h1>
	
	<p>Let me elaborate on why I've decided to call this carry on supersticious. The dictum of "stay home and protect each other" derives its meaning from the basic presumption that these "viruses" cause disease. This is what is meant by contagion, though contagion also refers to the spread of disease by means of pathogenic bacteria. This theory of infection via germs is wrong. Experiments have been done that show that the mode of spread of disease isn't through microorganisms. </p>
	
	<p>One such study was done in the 1910s, when the spanish flu was ravaging the USA. A doctor by the name of Milton J. Rosenau wanted to prove that <em>Pfeiffer Bacillus</em> (a bacterium) was responsible for the disease. He carried out an experiment, in which he exposed healthy individuals to the breath, the sputum and even the blood of "infected" individuals. Not one of them fell ill [0]. Let's consider too tuberculosis. It's a known fact that there some billions of people on the face of planet earth harbouring the bacterium deemed responsible for TB. Are all of these people sick? No. Now, within the germ theory paradigm, stumped reasearchers chock this down to latent TB. The active cases of horrible pneumonia supposedly prove that TBB causes TB. However, from outside the germ theory paradigm, this deduction makes no sense. There are a multitude of other <b>proven and experimentally</b> tested (insofar as inhaling lead and developing health issues) means that diseases can arise.</p>
	
	<p>Thes case study that all but proves, as much as anything can be proven, that germs are not responsible for the diseases we think they are. We have to look at what we eat, what we drink, what we breath in and how our mental state is. Florence nightingale herself, attacked germ theory, recounting her experiences having people develop illnesses where no vector for contagion could have existed. She's quoted as saying "There are no diseases: only disease conditions". These conditions are the inputs to the human body and mind, as I've described.</p>
	
	<p>The mechanism for germ pathogenesis is rumoured to be that these germs produce toxins that kill the cells in our body. There's also the idea that the germs "take over" body cells and kill them in some way. These deductions are actually fallacious. [reference]. Germs are present in damaged tissue not because germs damage the tissue, but because germs are saprophytic. They feed of dead and deccaying matter. And as for parasitic germs [refutation or admission of defeat].</p>
	
	<p>Why do antibiotics improve patient health then? Perhaps their tissues are already dying. [reference needing research]. Even we consider things from outside a germ theory paradigm, antibiotics may still serve a last resort role. However, the	 ideal of health has to shift from the eradication of germs to the maintenance of healthy tissues and cells, by avoiding toxins, having a good diet and having a good lifestyle</p>
	
	<p>Now, you might be thinking to yourself, about a family member, maybe your mom, or your gradmnother, or perhaps a close friend, who's illnesss and maybe even subsequent death was blamed on a germ. First, let me say, sorry for your loss, however  the veracity of a claim isn't swayed by forms in the realm of emotions. Propositional truth and falsehood exist in another plane to emotion, and I do not regard news stories along the likes of "Young healthy person dies of COVID-19" as meaningful. Fundamentally, if the claim is made that beacuse a doctor diagnosed somebody with a germ based sickness, the thesis that I'm presenting is incorrect, the claimant is still functioning in the germ theory paradigm, which I've shown to be dubious.</p>
	
	<p>Germ theory has gone through the scientific method. Observations have been made, hypotheses written and experiments have been done. Experiments that failed to prove their hypotheses. Rather than moving on, the world has been wooed by the charismatic fraud that was Loui Pasteur, and his theory of germs [2]. We all need to, like Pasteur did on his deathbed, forget this chapter of microbiology and say to ourselves: "the germ is nothing, the terrain is everything".</p>
